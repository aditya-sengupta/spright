class Signal:
    '''
    Class to encapsulate a time signal and its Walsh-Hadamard (W-H) transform.

    Attributes
    ---------
    n : int
    number of bits: log2 of the signal length.
    
    loc : iterable
    Locations of true peaks in the W-H spectrum. Elements must be integers in [0, 2 ** n - 1].
    
    strengths : iterable
    The strength of each peak in the W-H spectrum. Defaults to all 1s. Length has to match that of loc.
    
    noise_sd : scalar
    The standard deviation of the added noise.
    
    signal_t : numpy.ndarray
    The time signal.
    
    signal_w : numpy.ndarray
    The WHT of input_signal.
